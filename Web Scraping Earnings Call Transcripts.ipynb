       "\"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty first quarter 2023 earnings call. Please note this event is being recorded. During today's presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up, and we will aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's senior vice president of public and private investor relations. Please go ahead.Jordan Sadler -- Senior Vice President, Public and Private Investor Relations Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are president and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief investment officer, Greg Wright; chief technology officer, Chris Sharp; and chief revenue officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. First, our customer value proposition is resonating as we delivered yet another strong quarter of nearly $50 million of leasing in our zero to one-plus interconnection segment, including our second strongest quarter of bookings in EMEA and record interconnection bookings, helping to push interconnection revenue over $100 million in the quarter for the first time. Second, the first quarter delivered on the inflection and fundamentals we have guided to for 2023 as demonstrated by 4.5% releasing spreads on renewals and a 3.4% increase in stabilized portfolio cash NOI growth. And third, we remain confident in our funding plan for 2023. We are deeply engaged in the process with multiple institutional buyers, including new and existing partners, and we'll update you on specifics once we finalize the transactions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our president and CEO, Andy Power. Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty. This included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry. Last quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers. At the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last two quarters in the zero to one megawatt-plus interconnection segment. Since 2015, we've expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the Sentrum portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion, and Teraco. Today, our zero to one megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity-oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities. We expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across six continents. Importantly, according to Cloudscene's H2 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, digital Realty ranked in the top two slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region. Meanwhile, we've also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets, and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we've added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as service exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while talking to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world. These initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross-connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period. But there is more to do. Our vision is to serve a large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow, and for years to come. To do that, we served the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions leases to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements. Consistent with our strategic priorities, strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as managing director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly eight years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as chief revenue officer. Steve's experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team and look forward to an upcoming start in July. Let's move to our first-quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as releasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year over year. New leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong zero to one megawatt-plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history. We continue to over-index toward CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. During the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 net new logos that we've added in quarter since closing the Interxion transaction. RPU wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities. One of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers. One of the largest financial services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance. One of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia. We've continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, we continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained, and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity. Moving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a three-acre parcel win in Osaka, Japan, through our AMT Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner. While the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation. Given the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers. Notably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years. And we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply, and obsolescence. This is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down. I'd like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers, and individuals all over the world. While we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-of-state IT architectures, we are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms. These are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren't serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, and conscious of the amendment that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turning. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for much of the last 10 years has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious. With continued robust demand, strong net absorption has driven vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our releasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics. Our team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite plans almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers. We believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity, and the overall quality of our lives. We have not witnessed a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we've been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend toward outsourcing. Customers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital tenants. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity. We are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region. In addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA's Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 115-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over one gigawatt of renewable capacity. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.Matt Mercier -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the zero to one megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter. Zero to one megawatt-plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater-than-a-megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia. These deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio. Of course, as we have discussed on the last few calls, our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer. Over the course of the last three years, including the second half of 2022, we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q '23. As I'll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter-end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts. During the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our three regions. So, we're off to a good start relative to our full-year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the zero to one megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022. Greater-than-a-megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash releasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year. Turning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns, and a record quarter in interconnection revenue. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first-quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant-currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 19% year over year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year's energy price increases went into full effect in January. As most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year over year and 4% sequentially. While reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top-line revenue, including utility reimbursements from our customers, was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses since these expenses are directly borne by our customers. Interconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year over year and 4% sequentially. On our last two calls, we've highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds. Same-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q '22, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90-basis-point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators, and the benefit of positive releasing spreads. Turning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand, and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar's strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind. Turning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4 times. In January, we completed a $740 million two-year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a one-year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%. Leverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn't changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back toward the six times area by year-end. Our weighted average debt maturity is at five years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75. And our first-quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers. We are also modestly tweaking our euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year to date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full-year guidance, including cash and GAAP releasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So, we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fallout last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. , would you please begin the Q&A session? Questions & Answers: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [ instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.Nick Del Deo -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. You know, first, I want to drill into the greater-than-one-megawatt leasing a bit. Obviously, that's been a bit below history in Q1, and you called out Ashburn as a driver of that. I guess, just thinking about some of the other drivers there, maybe can you expand upon the degree to which that was the result of making conscious decisions to maybe dial back a bit given the change in the cost of capital versus market conditions or other factors? Thanks.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Nick. So, I'll kick it off, and I'll hand it to Corey. I would say there's no conscious decisions in dialing back or waving off business necessarily. You could see from our development life cycle, we've continued to raise the bar on our most strategic projects and fine-tuned capital allocations. I'd say it was a bit -- it was a little bit lower than prior run rates. But if you look at the prior year, which was a record and had a record quarter in there in the third quarter, I wouldn't say -- I think I won't over-index to anything other than call it the typical lumpiness you may have in that category. It was healthy in terms of pricing. I don't think we had a single deal pricing below $100 per kilowatt. But Corey, do you want to expand?Corey Dyer -- Chief Revenue Officer Yeah. I would tell you that -- thanks, Nick. Nothing's fundamentally really changed our relationship or our position with these hyperscalers in the greater-than-one-megawatt category. Coming off, as Andy mentioned, I think, Matt, maybe did in the prepared remarks a record year, and so I'd tell you, this is probably just a one-quarter timing issue, our hyperscale demand remains really healthy and varies a little bit by customer, but it's broad-based across the globe. Keep in mind, we didn't do Ashburn deals on that this last quarter. And I'd say that they're going through some digestion of their demand signals and maybe a little bit more scrutiny with the macro environment. but really confident in the macro demand, our relationships to execute. And keep in mind, we had our highest and our largest connectivity quarter with the hyperscalers this last quarter. And so, I just say that one quarter doesn't make a trend. I'd suggest you look at the multi-quarter trends, as well as they expand in new markets, new products like the advent of AI and their edge nodes that we're winning, and just new deployments across the globe. We're in a really good position with them from a pipeline perspective and demand. Thanks, Nick.Nick Del Deo -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. And I guess, more generally, obviously, the price environment is pretty favorable for you right now. I guess I'm interested in your thoughts on how you're balancing between raising prices on new space and renewal deals where market conditions allow it versus kind of thinking holistically about your relationships with your top 10 or 15 or 20 customers you do business with globally and trying not to alienate them or put the relationships.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Nick. I mean, we're always trying to take a holistic approach to these relationships. And as you see from our top customer list, our largest customers can be with 20, 30, 40, 50 different locations. At the same time, the pricing is dynamic to overall supply demand dynamics. And as inventory in various markets become more and more precious, we've seen that pendulum pricing move in our favor. We try to be straight shooters with the customer. We try to bring all the -- everything to the table in a holistic fashion. We've done this before in terms of bringing renewals and new business, expansions, all-in-one holistic approach. And I think this is not new. These are -- these big hyperscale customers are seeing cost of doing business going up. Many of them self-build themselves and see inflation in construction costs or labor. So, I think the understanding that the pricing dynamic is shifting a little bit toward the providers is playing out in a natural fashion.The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.Jonathan Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks. So, on Corey's response about kind of the leasing volumes telling us to look at kind of the prior multi-quarter trend, curious about interconnection and the trends going forward given kind of the strength there. And any kind of mix shift that you could kind of point to there may more how you're targeting your customers is a lot of that coming from existing logos or deserting your sales format to focus on interconnect-rich opportunities? And then, secondly, I guess, on the competitive front, given so many privately backed companies that are deploying a lot of capital into the sector. Does that affect your hyperscale sales pipeline at all?Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Thanks, Jon. On the first question, Sharp and I'll tag team that. I mean, I think I look at a few things. One, it's a holistic approach to these customers. There's a lot of good results in this quarter, whether it's the new logos, inflecting up 15% quarter over quarter, which was a high for several quarters, whether it was the overall interconnection plus less-than-a-megawatt signings, the regional contributions, including a standout interconnection quarter. And I'd also mention that this is a building momentum. It's been building over time for several quarters now. I think it's the power of the platform coming together, servicing our customers across 50-plus metros on six continents. It's the great work Corey team has done with the go-to-market. And I still would say that we got even further progress and even better results to deliver over time. This particular quarter did have I'd say, a lumpier win, let's call it, put it into the No. 1 category interaction interconnection signings. So, I'm not sure that's necessarily repeatable next quarter with another record. But some of the work that we're doing with service providers, I think Chris can touch on, I think it's going to continue to build that momentum. But Chris, pick it up from that, please?Chris Sharp -- Chief Technology Officer Yeah. Appreciate it, Andy. And thanks for the question, Jon. A couple of dynamics here where I think we've led by our core existing products. And I think your direct question to is it new logos or it's existing, it's both, right? I really want to emphasize the fact that the physical cross-connects reaching 214,000 and growing, it's something that we constantly have looked at and Andy referenced this earlier, growing the platform, right, investing, and making sure that customers know how to access one another to get further value out of the deployment is absolutely important to us. And so, just really watching how that evolves over time. And with the advent of the ServiceFabric and bringing that to market and what that's being able to do for our customers, we're just starting to see -- it's early innings, but future growth on virtual, right, where it's going to be married to where now they're going to be able to access multiple destinations in a more simplistic fashion, because of that product being purpose-built in the way that we brought it to market, it really removes a lot of the technical complexity that has precluded other customers from getting the full value out of the deployment. But one of the things I'm just very pleased about is this customer-led and balanced approach that we've been doing on even new markets inside of Europe. We've talked about in the past where just bringing the value or the pricing closer to parity in some of these markets -- we see really strong growth within Germany and France, where making sure that we're delivering those capabilities to those customers in all these critical markets around the globe. And I would just say lastly, I'm pleased with the fact that Digital has been able to provide one of the greatest quarters of interconnection signings in the company's history, and that's just really representative of the value we're bringing to the customers.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer And then, Jon, just around your second question about call -- competition from private back. That's not a new phenomenon. We've been competing against private players for some time now and the ones that have been taken private they've been private for, call it, multiple years for some of them. I think what's changed is the ability to deliver this business for our customers has just gotten harder and harder, and at a global scale. And whether it's power, constraints, staffing, supply chains -- and certainly, cost and access to capital has certainly not been a friend of some of our competitors. And I think our largest customers in the hyperscale arena turn to us given our permanence in our space. We're not here, gone tomorrow. We've invested for the long run. We're future-proofing that growth. We're constantly building for that growth with our suppliers. And I think all those things probably make it leave a little bit more advantageous versus some of those private bank names in an environment like today.The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.Jon Petersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thank you. I was hoping we could talk about the leverage target. You guys reiterated getting down to six times leverage, and I know you're working through these various transactions. But I guess if you complete the $2 billion of transactions. I, mean, does that get you to six times? Like, can you just give us the moving pieces on getting to that target?Matt Mercier -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks. So, I mean, the simple answer is, yes. So, our capital plan, I think, as we laid out last quarter, and it really hasn't changed coming into this quarter, is based on, call it, $2-plus billion of capital recycling from our joint venture opportunities, as well as the potential for noncore dispositions. And as that capital comes in, as well as our expected growth in EBITDA this year, which is a little shy of 10%. We believe that by the end of the year, largely those two items will get us back toward that six times area this year.Jon Petersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Great. And then if I could just ask on development. I'm curious, given the shift in cost of capital, like what's the minimum development yield? Or maybe you just talk broadly about how much those requirements for you guys have moved in the last year or so? Like, what does it take for you guys to start a development today in terms of return expectations?Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jon. I mean, we do an incredibly granular market-by-market assessment here. So, it really depends on the market and the relative risk fee rates and risk premiums. I would just by and large, and this is not something that just showed up in our approach this quarter, three quarters ago almost, we basically took a posture that we need to raise the bar on capital allocation and prioritize our most strategic projects, call it, highest-return -- not only highest-return but also projects to generate the high long-term growth as well. So, I don't have a single number answer to get -- to give you there, but I think you'll see that come through our development returns at table as those numbers are inching into higher territory, and I can tell you more strategic long-term growth projects.Jon Petersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.Michael Rollins -- Citi -- Analyst Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the capital recycling topic. And just when we look at the guidance page, there's a wide range of outcomes. And what would be a good outcome for Digital in terms of the yield? And what would the scenario be in which you may just decide there's alternative forms of capital that are better than recycling? And then just a second topic but related, if I could take a step back. As I think about the comments you've made about considering both stabilized assets and development for monetization, just curious if there's a more profound change in the business strategy and financial model that investors should be mindful of in terms of how this business, over the next couple of years, might look different in terms of the quantum of investment in a given year and the level of financial performance that you're driving off of those investments, just following on the comments you just made. Thanks.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer So, Mike, a good outcome is we essentially get the, call it, $2 billion of funding completed. The range is wide, but the majority of that capital, the range is not that wide. The wide range is due to some of the noncore asset sales, as well as the development, which is, call it, 25% of the $2 billion, right? But if you look at the majority, the 75%, which is stabilized joint ventures or development, those are zero-yielding projects. On stabilized joint ventures, as I think the cap rates are in the low single-digit type category based on what we're seeing, call it, six-ish type territory. And I think that's based on not what we see externally but third-party transactions. What we've seen on recent transactions with partners that we can recapitalize with our portfolio. and through our progress on these capital recycling and joint venture efforts. Holistically, more longer term here, we are looking to become more balance sheet efficient. We are -- what's not new is, call it, finishing out the noncore dispose. What's not new is joint-venturing majority states in stabilized hyperscale-oriented projects that have lower long-term growth rates due to the credit quality and size of the customers, be it through rent bumps or pricing power. What is new is sharing a piece of both of our North America and EMEA development. as it relates to hyperscale projects. And we're doing that with a view that these projects keep getting larger and larger and larger. That income nonincreasing drag, it remains a headwind, even though it is a significant long-term value creation. And we believe there's ample partners to work with us on those projects. which will ultimately make our balance sheet more efficient and more rapidly accelerate revenue and EBITDA drop into our bottom line.The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Michael Elias -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess first, just to double-click on what you said about balance sheet efficiency. Just as it relates to the development JV, aside from recouping the previously spent capex, is the intention of that JV to structurally reduce the on-balance sheet capex for digital? Or is the intention to keep capex more or less the same while being able to increase the set of opportunities you can pursue? And then I have a follow-up.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer The simple answer, Michael, is we're looking to partner around large-scale development projects where there will be incremental spend that we and our partner will jointly fund over time so that it will -- we're looking for -- these are large projects, large swaths of acreage, large quantities and megawatts. Hence, the quality of capital or spend is not the entirety or near the entirety of where the project ultimately will be over time. So, they would fund alongside us through the coming quarters.Michael Elias -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst OK. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit. You know, earlier on the call today, you're really emphasizing the steps you've made on the colo/enterprise side. Today, you also announced the appointment of Steve Smith. Clearly a focus on accelerating colo and connectivity. I mean, my question for you would be, as we consider the path ahead, what are the changes that you feel need to be made internally in order for you to really accelerate on that, call it, zero to one megawatt side? Thanks.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer So, Michael, I mean, again, I think this ties back to the first three strategic priorities I laid out in the prior call about really strengthening -- demonstrate strengthening our customer value proposition. We took advantage of this call to remind folks that this is not something we started with me becoming the CEO four months ago. This is something that's been in the works for roughly eight years through both inorganic and organic measures, putting together critical puzzle pieces expanding across the globe in terms of where the customers need our capacity, adding connectivity hubs, and innovating and bringing more to our customers, adding -- we've changed up our go-to-market motion over time. What we go from here is, again, accelerating from that success. A piece of that -- delighted to have Steve Smith on board to lead our essentially newly created Americas region. Steve comes with a tremendous background of really driving the -- one of the only U.S.-only focused interconnection and colo platforms in a prior -- previously a very formidable competitor. And I think he's going to be very added to that our team, our leadership table. The incremental things that we're doing in terms of continuing to innovate and bring more value to our customers. Chris touched upon ServiceFabric, which I still would characterize as just out of the bar in terms of where we're going in terms of bringing more partners onto that platform and drilling more value to our customers. There's a whole host of things that I'd say we're doing behind the scenes to continue to accelerate our growth -- and I think the fruits of our labor are continuing to build each and every quarter in terms of success. So, I think there's multiple angles that we are moving toward in that endeavor to be one of a very short list of global interconnection colo providers. And I think the industry demands and the broader competitive backdrop also are also our wind and solar sales.Corey Dyer -- Chief Revenue Officer And then, Andy, just one thing to add from a go-to-market perspective. We've had a ton of success around the channel. We're continuing to grow the channel. I think this last quarter, 38% of our new logos were from the channel. Prior years, it was 31%. We're continuing to build on that success. We see the channel as being a huge advocate and a partner through their lens with all the enterprises. So, we're going to see that continue to build. So, we're doing a lot of functional and strategic operational items that we need to do. We're also continuing to tweak and evolve our go-to-market, we think it's going to continue to add value.The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Thank you. On the releasing spreads, thinking about greater than a megawatt in particular, but kind of with all of them, is there anything you see coming up in the year that could possibly push those spreads back negative by any large renegotiations? And then what is sort of the longer-term outlook with the bookings down a little bit, but pricing doing better, what sort of yield are we looking at going forward versa, you've got in the last couple of years when the bookings were higher?Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Matt, I'll kick it off in releasing spreads, and we can tag teams in the longer-term outlook pieces.Matt Mercier -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, thanks, Frank. I think, one, first, I'd reiterate, we're obviously off to a great start here with positive releasing spreads, again, not only across all product types but across all regions. I will say we're -- we feel confident that this positive pricing environment that we're in is sustainable and it's here to stay. I'm not going to necessarily speak about every single quarter. But again, I'd come back and reiterate that we're off to a great start. And we see that term for full year that we expect to be positive for the full year, not only in the zero to one megawatt category but also in the greater than a megawatt category, something which I think is, again, something we haven't seen in a few years. And and reflects the positive environment and turn in fundamentals that we're seeing not only from that but then down into our stabilized portfolio as well.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Frank, do you want to repeat that second part of your question just to make sure we hear it correctly?Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst Yes. I mean, leasings are down a little bit, obviously better pricing. What does the yield look like now versus, say, the last couple of years ago when bookings were higher and so forth? And how long do you think this is sustainable? What sort of yields are you seeing coming in now even though the absolute bookings are a little bit lower?Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Frank, I'd direct you to our development table to follow see the progression of yields. I would say the yields are improving in our favor. The pricing dynamic is outpacing the inflationary pressures. It's not an overnight phenomenon, but we are moving into a better territory. I mean, you can look at episodic things like Ashburn, Virginia, where, quite frankly, the rates have pretty much doubled in a pretty short time from deals in the, call it, low $70s to now, call it, market rates of, call it, $140, and that's flowing to the bottom line and enhancing those deals dramatically. So, I think that table is a work in progress in our sub because it's got a lot of pre-leasing, some of which was signed prior to some of this price progression. But as we continue to add more projects to that that are not released or we fill out the leasing on the available capacity, I think there's ability to raise those yields. And I would also say the North America piece of that has a large project in it that is an open book build-to-suit to a very highly rated financial institution on a triple net lease basis. So, it's an apple to the oranges there in a good way. It's been dramatically derisked in terms of its build and in terms of its ongoing revenue and EBITDA stream at the same time, lowering our Americas yields.Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you very much.The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead.David Guarino -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Thanks. Andy, in the press release, you were quoted as saying that you're seeing broad-based demand and reduced data center availability. I was just wondering, why do you think that isn't translating into outsized growth in rental rates like we've seen across other commercial real estate sectors like industrial or self-storage? And it definitely feels like the pendulum has firmly swung back to landlords, but data center rents just aren't rising like we've seen elsewhere.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say, I mean, it's a new phenomenon in terms of recent history of the data centers, which is still, I'd call a nascent asset class, but we are seeing it. If you look at, call it, our less than quarter megawatt signings, either the Americas region or EMEA region where there's critical consistent massive new signings, the rates have been up, call it, four quarters in a row. And that example I gave you, in Ashburn, Virginia, from rates going from $70-plus to $140-plus. That is quite a run. And I know I'm picking out one particular market there, an example, but it is the largest and most diverse market out there, our largest market as well. And it's thanks to the East Coast with a power constraint problem, but the West Coast is having the same low with Santa Clara now having power constraints to likely outpace when power comes online in Virginia. And I think this phenomenon is going to continue in other parts of the world, not just the U.S. And I think you're going to continue to see those rates move more and more in our favor. David, I know you're a student of the traditional real estate asset classes. I mean, it was a good 20 years where industrial had no rate growth before it's had the renaissance that's been experienced in the last few years. And I'm not saying that that's going to happen to data centers. but it feels like we're teeing ourselves up way for a healthier pricing environment for the incumbents.David Guarino -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst That's encouraging to hear. And then maybe kind of sticking with that theme, you said we -- we've been hearing some similar chatter also about difficulty securing power in some other markets. I've heard Chicago come on the radar and possibly even Hillsboro now. So, given just -- it feels like these are popping up everywhere across the industry, -- what do you think that means for your pace of new leasing activity going forward? I mean, are the things we saw in the years past probably unlikely to happen just given the power constraints?Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. If you look at our financials, we've got a sizable amount of contiguous land capacity and available power that's committed to us outside of these, call it, zones of disruption. But longer term, eventually, we will exhaust that, and you could have that phenomenon. At the same time, when you're doing business at twice the rates, you have to sell half the kilowatts in certain markets. So, I'm not sure that the top-line pacing on our new signings will be all that disrupted near term based on what we have in the table in terms of capabilities and estimated power. But I agree with you on this assessment, and it's going to continue. The other thing I'd emphasize is we're actively managing our platform and our capabilities, and we're essentially always looking to reprioritize for higher, better use when applicable. So, if we have churn, which this is not a totally static business, it provides opportunity to release that capacity at higher rate opportunities and often higher better uses toward some granular enterprise colocation-oriented customers. And on a big company like digital, you probably don't see that. It's not top of the waves, but that's happening in terms of how we manage our footprint.David Guarino -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Matt Niknam -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two if I could. First, on the capital recycling, not to beat a dead horse, but you did talk about being deeply engaged in the process. I'm just wondering if there's any more color you can share on the progress made thus far across the different buckets that you've laid out. And then maybe switching gears. On AI, I mean, we've heard so much about this over the last several months. I'm just wondering how the increased focus on AI impacted your customer leasing plans and your conversations with them as they think about deployment plans over the next year. Thanks.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to have Greg tackle the first one, and then Sharp and I can both tackle the second one.Greg Wright -- Chief Investment Officer Thanks, Matt. Look, I'd say, look, with respect to our capital initiatives, I'd say we're still on track with the plan we outlined in our earnings call in early February. But you should recall that was the $500 million of the noncore dispositions, call it, roughly 750 from core JVs and 750 from development JVs. And I would characterize it without saying too much, is that we're making good progress in these transactions. And we've received significant interest from multiple institutional partners, whether it's sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure funds, PE, real estate funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and the like. So, the way I'd characterize it is we're executing on plan. And we feel good about where we are into these processes.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer And turning to your second question -- just one quick thing for I turn over to Chris to give his view on AI. The -- I think a misnomer here is that, in my opinion, that everyone thinks every data center is going to turn into one that's going to be supporting artificial intelligence. The use cases, the applications, the workloads that exist today are still going to be thriving within the global data center footprint and Digital. Yes, we have many data centers that lend themselves toward supporting the increasing power densities and cooling environments that will be required, and we're doing a lot of that as we speak. But I look at more -- the bigger picture around AI is that this is an incremental major wave of long-term demand that will certainly need to have proximity to the major data that sits today. And the first two waves of demand of moving from on-prem locations to hybrid locations and the second wave of multi-cloud haven't even hit the shore yet while this next wave of demand, it is falling behind it. But Chris, why don't you speak a little bit your view on AI?Chris Sharp -- Chief Technology Officer Yeah. No, absolutely. I appreciate the question. A couple of pieces. Just to reiterate what Andy said, the existing cloud infrastructure we have today, AI is cloud adjacent because of a lot of the applications, it's empowering, and the way the customers are bringing it to market it's something we've been watching for many, many years. And I think one of the pieces I always try to emphasize is that a lot of the R&D from the hyperscalers and from the technological providers has been happening within Digital, which has allowed us to evolve our infrastructure with this demand. And I would reiterate also that there are pockets of AI that we're able to support rather efficiently. And I think this is something that's unique to Digital's designs and the R&D work that we've been doing with some of the cooling technologies it's really important for us to continue to support the broader spectrum of the customer requirements. So, not only their traditional type of digital transformation, but we are seeing more and more customers show up with AI-specific requirements and association with that digital transformation. And then the last one is, really emphasizing that to the customer base to design early and understand the implications of not only the power, but the interconnectivity. And just to circle back to why we believe the value of PlatformDIGITAL is differentiated is the ability to interconnect in an open fashion with the right partners in a very simplistic manner is what's making a lot of these AI deployments successful. And so, that's the core of how we continue to focus on AI and bringing that to market in a very repeatable fashion. And so, you'll see some recent sales tools we'll start talking about publicly to visualize how you tie together this infrastructure on a global basis. So, very exciting about this additive demand coming to market, and you'll see more and more of the use cases and case studies coming out on the success that our customers are having within PlatformDIGITAL.The last question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Eric Luebchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch base on Ashburn. It sounds like the transmission line has been approved to be in service by late 2025 year at Digital. When do you think you might be able to start additional development in that market? And do you think you're seeing any spillover impacts in terms of other markets or submarkets where you're seeing additional activity levels because of the tightness in Ashburn? And I guess just related to that on the pricing front, I think you mentioned that you're seeing rents as high as $140. I think a lot of your rents in Ashburn are rolling at $80 or $90. So, just wondering if you have any color on what you've seen on the releasing spreads across that market and what you expect going forward? Thank you.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. So, we touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks. The good news is that the powers that be in the region are sorting out ways to bring incremental power to the region by 2026. I think the -- from there, I think you'll see a much more rational providing power to that market. And I do think it's going to behoove ourselves to be -- our history and track record of working in that region is going to keep us top of queue when power becomes more freely. Between now and then, We, last quarter, had a good fortune having worked with the local to providers to be able to deliver on all of our customer commitments, which is fantastic. We do believe that we will be able to bring on incremental growth capacity in this market between now and 2026 through called some development, as well as some churn. We are working through all the resources we have in terms of excess power at sites, customers that may not be using their suites and be able to go -- to spare some capacity -- so I don't have a fine point of the quantity, but I don't believe our shelves at Digital will be bearing, and we will be able to support our customers, certainly our colocation customers and some of our hyperscale customers we'll be able to grow with Digital in Ashburn in the coming years. And then we get a finer point on the quantities probably in lockstep with leasing in that capacity, we'll certainly be happy to share. In terms of spillover effect, the spillover is real. Manassas, I think is front and center of a spillover market to the Loudoun County pinch point. I would say that's -- we've seen the greatest spillover effect. But there's always potential some of the non-Northern Virginia markets. We'll continue to -- but I don't think -- I don't see anyone packing their wagons and leaving Ashburn due to this. I think the momentum has been building for years, and it's called out escape velocity in terms of its criticality to the data center industry and its customers.Eric Luebchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Great. Thank you.This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead.Andy Power -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty is off to a strong start to the year. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with customers, which was confirmed by our record interconnection signings, continued strength in the zero to one megawatt category, and strong new logo additions.

       "\"Greetings, and welcome to the Prologis fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [ instructions] I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jill Sawyer, vice president, investor relations. Thank you. You may begin.Jill Sawyer -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, Diego, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com, under investor relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results, press release, and supplemental do contain financial measures, such as FFO and EBITDA, that are non-GAAP measures.And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions, and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We've had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors, putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come. Turning to results. Core FFO excluding promotes was $4.61 per share, and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast. In the fourth quarter, our operating results again generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2% with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio, excluding Duke, added 30 of the 40 basis-point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step-down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents. In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%. These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. Duke portfolio, having closed on October 3rd, is fully integrated in these results, with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024. On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets has remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including 700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent, and we've maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end, with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-end funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition. With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottom line is that conditions remain healthy, and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand. And when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history. And given persistent low vacancy, there are simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidence, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all-time record. And deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions. While we were watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales has increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing, and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy, or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space in market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet, and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today toward 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late '23 or '24. In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%. Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In capital markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low to mid 7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect. Our U.S. values, which are appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half. In Europe, the values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand, and undrawn equity commitments. While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units, call equity, and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be one or two quarters away, likely sooner in Europe. This will ensure certainty, fairness, and consistency to all of our investors. Turning to our outlook for 2023. While our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact, unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our '23 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally. We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point, given the environment. Specific to our portfolio and on our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the '22 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effect of same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9%, with cash same-store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%. Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increase over '23, and in the year between 65% and 70%, and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation and wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our essentials business, particularly in the energy teams. In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from '22, but offset in the near term by a higher Duke-related share count and the G&A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year, driving the portfolio to approximately 520 megawatts by year-end. It's worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end. In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts. We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank. And between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets respect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant. As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues excluding promotes to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across '22 and the first half of '23. We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that values in USLF, primary source of '23 promotes, will decline further from values at year-end. Every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5 and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We're guiding core FFO including promotes to range between $5.40 and $5.50 per share. In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional three-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 investor day, we presented a three-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth. It achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance. We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and value creation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market, significant and visible opportunity in our land bank, a need for excitement for -- a need and excitement for a new-generation of sustainable energy solutions, and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser-focused on delivering leading results. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Questions & Answers: [ instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please state your question.Steve Sakwa -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yeah, thanks. I guess good morning out there. Tim, I just wanted to clarify, and you're kind of going through your guidance. You know, you threw out a lot of numbers. I just want to be sure. On the mark-to-market numbers that are embedded in your same-store NOI growth of 8% to 9% GAAP and 8.5% to 9.5% cash, just what are you expecting for cash and GAAP leasing spreads? And I just want to make sure that's different than the kind of overall portfolio mark-to-market you talked about of 65% to 70%.Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, they're going to be stronger. As you think about the lease mark-to-market, it's all of the leases or it represents old leases and leases just done. So, clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% we're quoting today. It's a little bit flatter than you might expect as we've looked at it. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis. And then, as we know, the cash basis of that is trended toward probably 1,500 basis points or so inside of that.Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question.Craig Mailman -- Citi -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to hit on the capital deployment side of things. You know, maybe a two-parter here. Just first, on the stabilization. So, just kind of the -- what you guys have stabilizing the 2.8 billion at your share. Can you just bridge that gap versus the 5.5 billion that you have on Page 20 of expected deliveries or completions in 2023? And maybe just give us some sense of timing on that. I know I think about 30% of those are build-to-suit. So, also, how you're thinking about where the pre-leasing is on the balance of that as well and kind of how that layers into your occupancy assumption.Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer OK. I'll take the -- hey, Craig, it's Tim. I'll take the first half. And Dan can help us on the second. This is really a date issue, I would say. Not even an issue but just a function of the date. We have a large amount of that group of stabilization we believe will occur in the first quarter of '24. And I think there is a very real possibility that if we improve some of the leasing timing by just a month or two, we could see a decent amount of that actually fall back into '23. So, it's just a function of crossing over a calendar year the way the mix of all of our projects is landing.Dan Letter -- Global Head, Capital Deployment This is Dan. I'll just pile on there. The pre-leasing in that portfolio, as you see, there's 29% of that. That's in there as a build-to-suit. The pre-leasing is better than that 29% and, I would say, on track with historical averages, even on a bigger data set here. So, we feel really good about delivering our stabilization to this year and next.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please state your question.Ki Bin Kim -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thanks, and good morning. I was curious about the investment capacity that you showed in your supplemental of 1.5 billion. It is down from 4.2. I just want to understand what that actually represents. And tying that to your comments about contributions perhaps picking back up if conditions settle out, how does that come in compared to that $1.5 billion capacity? And how much wiggle room do you ultimately have in increasing that capacity? Thank you.Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ki Bin. So, what I would do with regard to investment capacity is rely more on the way I'm describing in our prepared remarks that the 20 billion and the 4 billion, 5 billion across the funds, the number that's presented in the sub, which is what I think you're referring to, is a bit technical about the current amount of equity that can be drawn in the funds. And then, that number is levered slightly, so that's why it's a bit understated. The number we supplement it with in prepared remarks is looking at the overall leverage of the fund and how much more capacity sits beyond just out of committed equity post-leverage. So, for example, our U.S. select venture is very low leverage, just about 10%. And that creates an incredible amount of debt capacity, as you can imagine. And I think that winds up addressing your second question, which is, you know, the liquidity in the funds for contributions, there's a lot there for us to tap over time.Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.Derek Johnston -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi, everyone. How are you doing? Can you give us an update on the markets in Europe, the mark-to-market there, any leasing trends? I think you touched briefly on the private market transaction backdrop. You know, definitely, we see the U.S. mark-to-market getting wider. Just how do you view demand in Europe and the differences between the U.S. and Europe unfolding in '23? Thank you.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Let me start with some general comments. Europe is generally a milder, more muted version of the U.S., both on the way up and on the way down. And the market has a lower vacancy rate than the U.S., if you can believe it. So, that's the general backdrop. That's very consistent with the way Europe has behaved in the last 10 or 15 years. As to the specifics on mark-to-market and the like, Dan, do you want to cover that?Dan Letter -- Global Head, Capital Deployment Yeah, sure. Mark-to-market -- lease mark-to-market in Europe is about 28%. And I would say, just overall, we feel very good about the leasing demand in Europe right now. We talked about in the remarks about an expansion in the vacancy. But overall, we feel really good about where it's headed.Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer You know, and you might ask, what about the U.K. because that's the one you hear about all the time. And actually, that's really strong too so far. So, we've actually been surprised on the positive side with the U.K. The other place that is really held up well is actually Germany, which you would have guessed with energy issues would be softer. It hasn't been, and there's virtually no vacancy in Germany. And some of the manufacturing coming back, particularly autos, etc., are really strengthening. Central and Eastern Europe, the markets, particularly Poland, where there's a perennial vacancy, is sort of tightening up.Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please state your question.Nick Yulico -- Scotiabank -- Analyst Thanks. I want to dig in a little bit to the sectors that you're seeing driving leasing demand. You know, let's say in the fourth quarter and so far this year, you know, whether you've seen any changes in types of customers taking space versus a year ago. And then, I guess, when we think about the broader retailer bucket, where you did see some retailers reporting year-over-year sales declines in the back half of last year, you know, wondering if any pieces of that category is seeing less demand.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. The only category that is significantly below trend and is likely to be that way is housing. Because the starts are slowing. But with respect to other details, Chris, you want to take that?Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research Yeah, that's absolutely right. Generally, Nick, it was diverse. So, whether we look at consumer products, whether we look at apparel, food and beverage customers, we have a diverse range of customers leasing space from us beyond the housing categories, which would include construction and could include home goods and the like.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And retail sales, on a real basis, notwithstanding the weaker prints in December and November, are good. You know, I think it's between 2.5% and 3% up from the year before. So, yeah, you do hear the headlines of the weaker retailers. But I think if you look at it overall, it's actually pretty positive. It's more positive than the headline. So, I wouldn't say it's super positive, but it's much better than the headlines.Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question.Michael Goldsmith -- UBS -- Analyst Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You clearly laid out the building blocks of your same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2023, where you have a high level of visibility. Obviously, a lot of macro uncertainty out there. Can you provide the specific assumptions you've used for your initial 2023 outlook and then just where and how a change in the macro environment could provide upside or downside to your initial guidance? Thanks.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, let me just start that, and Tim will take you through the specifics. Actually, the assumptions about the macro environment, other than call it defaults or something that has an immediate effect, are not going to drive the numbers big time in 2023 because a lot of the leasing that needs to take place in 2023 is already in progress or have been dealt with. We're dealing with very high occupancy levels. To start with, there is not a whole lot of space to lease. And the real driver of those same-store numbers is the huge mark-to-market in the portfolio that already exists. So, that's -- so don't expect -- even if we change the assumptions by a lot, the numbers for 2023 are not going to move that much. They will obviously move as you get further along into the future. So, that's one comment that I would make. The second comment I would make is that in every year in the last three or four years, we started the year with the rental assumptions that we have exceeded, sometimes by a factor of three to 4x. So, I'm not saying that's going to happen this year, but there is absolutely no reason in the world to go crazy on our assumptions with respect to rental rates, particularly they don't have an effect in 2023 anyway. So, we'll see how it plays. And if we see evidence of stronger rental growth, and my bet would be a surprise on the upside over our assumptions, not the other way around, then we'll let you know and you can adjust the numbers accordingly. Tim?Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Just building on that. Michael, if you -- you know, within the supplemental, you can see our lease expiration schedule out of that. You'll see we have about 13% rolling. And that's a mix of what is stated as expiring, which is another 9%, but also things that we've already addressed ahead of entering the year here. So, the footnotes will tell you that. You get the 13% there. As Hamid said, start with the 67% lease mark-to-market. We've got 10% market rent growth of the year. You assume we'll get that halfway, halfway through the year. One thing we see people get wrong is that it will take you to a certain amount of rent change. We actually get half that rent change this year. You get half of '22's rent change as well. That's a mathematic thing that you need to be mindful of, given the quantum of rent change we're talking about lately. That will all get you to close to 9%. And then, we've backed off, you know, an assumption on occupancy loss, which we couldn't point to right now but just feels prudent in the environment. So, we've taken our guidance down there a bit.Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please go ahead.Vince Tibone -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. How should we think about the organic same-store NOI growth for the legacy Duke portfolio in '23, given then that, you know, outside of guidance? Is it lower than guidance for the legacy PLD portfolio in the same ballpark? Just given the size of the Duke deal, any color you could share would be helpful.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, it will be lower for one reason anyway, which is that they started at the higher level of occupancy. So, putting even rents aside, on a same-store basis, there's less opportunity. They generally had longer-term leases because they generally had bigger spaces. So, that affects the mix. But, Tim?Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Well, and I think an important thing to remember here, and we've seen some people not have this entirely correct in modeling, is just understanding that on a GAAP basis, there will be very little same-store. There's potential for some. But because we market the leases up to market now at close, on a net effective basis, there will be very little same-store growth and as contemplated in our guidance. On a cash basis, I expect it would look quite similar to Prologis.Vince Tibone -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst That's really helpful.Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer Great.Thank you. Our next question comes from --Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer By the way, if I can continue that. One thing that you didn't ask, but it's important in this context, and Dan can elaborate, is that the rental performance of the Duke portfolio on the few spaces that have come up for releasing or were in progress during the time we were doing the transaction are trending significantly higher than what we had underwritten. Dan, can you quantify that?Dan Letter -- Global Head, Capital Deployment Yeah, I'd actually go as far as saying we expect to outperform in the operating portfolio to the tune -- you know, 11% to 13%, call it. Now, 8% of that's going to come from market rent growth. So, really 3% to 5% of that comes from just operating that portfolio in the Prologis platform.Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.Tom Catherwood -- BTIG -- Analyst Thanks. Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the outlook for '23 assumes a recession. And if we look back to previous recessionary cycles, you know, usually, we get declines in consumption, which drives lower demand for industrial space. But we've also never started a cycle with kind of persistently low vacancy like we have right now or tailwinds from e-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration. So, kind of within that backdrop of assuming a recession, how do you think it could be different this time and kind of what you have baked into your numbers for that for '23?Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, given that Tim was in kindergarten when the cycle started, Tim and I are a little bit different on our recession outlook, but I don't think it matters. I think Tim would tell you that if there's a recession, there's a very mild recession. And my bet would be that we wouldn't have a recession, but it would be close to zero GDP growth for a while. So, you know, call it recession or no recession, but the same outcome. I think what's different about the other cycles, and I say that with a lot of dislike for the word -- for the phrase that's different this time is that there were really two situations where we had negative absorption in the U.S., which is where we have data. One was on thehill.com. And there you had a high vacancy rate. On top of it, you had a very low utilization rate because there was a lot of capital for these dot.com, particularly e-commerce retailers, and they were taking space way ahead of demand. So, there was a lot of shadow space, too. So, when you add those two, it was a very, very high vacancy type of market during that time. So, 2000, 2001 time frame. The next time you had a pretty significant negative absorption was 2008, 2009, and we all know the reasons for that. And there, you also started with a significantly higher vacancy rate. I think it was 7% or 8% before the music stopped. And all I can tell you is that Prologis, the old Prologis with the funny [Inaudible] loan, had 52 million square feet of vacant spec space that they had to lease. I think AMB at the time had like 8 million or 9 million square feet. So, nothing like you're talking about here, particularly given the different scale of the company and how at least we're starting out. Now, even in that situation, where we're normally at about 95% occupancy, we went down to about 91% in both cases. So, I don't see anything near that. I mean, it's mathematically impossible. Even if absorption goes to zero right now and we don't lease any more of the underdevelopment spec space and absorption goes to zero, I mean, you know, you will be under 5% vacancy, which used to be considered a great strong market and the capital up. We didn't have this kind of mark-to-market. I mean the mark-to-markets in those days were in the mid single-digit range. And now, we're talking about 70% almost. So, a very different picture.Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please state your question.Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question about market rents, actually, so the 10% market run forecast in the U.S. Can you just discuss that or break it out a little bit for us in terms of coastal versus noncoastal in terms of your expectations, just in the context of, you know, supply growth that you're seeing and the demand backdrop in general?Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research Yeah. Hey, it's Chris Caton. So, indeed, we expect 10% in the U.S. That's going to vary. You know, typical spread between coastal, noncoastal is 300 to 500 basis points. At least that's where it was running, say, pre-pandemic. And we expect a wider spread in the current environment. So, whether you look at vacancy, whether you look at the under construction pipeline, whether you look at the momentum in pricing in the back half of last year, including fourth quarter, that leads you to conclude on the coastal outperformance continuing at a greater than historical average in 2023.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey, I just want to go back to some of the comments on the third-party management. I think you talked about valuations being down 7% in the back half of last year and potentially continuing into this year, and the redemptions potentially ending in the first two quarters of the year. Just want to get a sense. Any more color how you're thinking about that? Is it because the valuations have been repriced that you expect sort of the redemptions to stop? What should we be looking for to get more confidence in that? Thanks.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, there are two things that usually drive a redemption request. One is sort of the denominator effect and people needing the liquidity. And two is some folks want to arbitrage the lag between, you know, how quickly the public markets adjust and the backward-looking appraisal process. In our experience in past downturns, the second has taken about three quarters to be fully reflected in appraisals. So, we really don't want to disadvantage one group of investors. By the way, the vast majority of our investors, 95% of them, because, you know, a couple of points of people want to arbitrage that difference. So, we want to make sure the valuations are right before those things transact. We think Europe has actually adjusted quicker than the U.S. And that's why we think there's maybe another quarter to go before Europe fully adjusts. So, we're committed to taking care of those redemptions in the next quarter. And we think the U.S. may take another quarter to adjust, and we'll take care of those in the second quarter. Here is what's important and people don't get about the structure of our funds. First of all, our leverage is in the low 20% range on these funds. So, there is boatloads of liquidity in these funds to basically be able to handle any redemption requests, any reasonable redemption requests. And secondly, we started with a queue, and we started with some cash on hand. So, again, there are lots of sources for addressing those redemption requests. I think you should assume that redemptions that have been effective as of the end of this quarter will by and large be taken care of by the middle of the year and sooner in Europe. So, you can model that math beyond that. Now, I'll tell you one other thing, which is kind of interesting. Prologis could be a buyer up in these funds. And in fact, even in the global financial crisis, where the old AMB was in a tighter spot with respect to leverage, we actually stepped up and bought, on very attractive terms with adjusted values, couple of hundred million dollars of real estate. And, you know, we actually offered it to our outside investors first, and then we stepped in and bought it. And you know what? The next quarter, all the redemptions went away because people realized that -- you know, the people who know the most about this portfolio are buyers at this price. So, it's really about getting the values right. And, you know, we started writing down these portfolios a quarter or two ago, and our appraisal process is independent. We have nothing to do about it. And that's very, very different than some of the redemption situations that we've all been reading about.Thanks. Our next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question.Camille Bonnel -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. On your development guidance, can you give us some color on how much conservatism is built into your development starts? And also, you're expecting another year of strong stabilizations. What assumptions are you making in terms of timing of these projects? And is any of the increase in guidance driven by projects from last year taking longer to complete due to longer construction timelines?Dan Letter -- Global Head, Capital Deployment This is Dan. Let me start with this year's development start guidance. We're coming off our largest year of starts ever. And just given the macro headlines, we decided to take a little bit more balanced approach, where we slowed our starts at the end of last year. We don't expect to start up in earnest until the last half of this year. We think the buildup of business will pick up at the same time. So, call it conservatism, I call it discipline. And just feel really good about our approach given the volumes over the last year or two. And then, stabilization next year, stabilization this year, Tim mentioned it earlier. We think we can outperform what we have in the books right now. Demand continues to be strong. We talked about the development starts plummeting in the marketplace in the fourth quarter. We think they're going to be slower in the first half of the year. And we think that bodes well for absorption in the last half of this year into next year. So, we feel very good about our guidance.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, there's not been a material delay in any of our construction projects if you look at them on an aggregated basis. So, that has not shifted stabilizations from '22 to '23 or anything like that. Yeah, I can't even think of an example that comes close. And even on the cost side, you know, because we've been thoughtful about procurement and securing some of these type of supplies ahead of time, that's been actually something that we use as a competitive advantage in marketing to build-to-suits because we got a bunch of steel, and we got a bunch of our air conditioning units and electric panels. And things that are in short supply are already sitting in our warehouse waiting to be deployed into our land bank. So, no, there's nothing funny going on about that. And by the way, the stabilizations are not just a function of completion of construction, but also leasing being stabilized at 90% or more. And that factor hasn't delayed stabilizations either. We've been leasing actually ahead of plan to this day. And I think we'll -- I expect to continue to do that.Thank you. Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.John Kim -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. On the subject of fund redemptions, there are some unlisted funds or nontraded REITs with a different leverage profile than yours, different investor base that are seeing a significant amount of redemption requests. And I was wondering if you anticipate this will lead to increased asset sales on the block and potentially some more opportunities for you on the acquisition side.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I hope it does. I'm not optimistic that it will because, you know, if you look at even the denominator problem for most institutions and the fact that they generally have to reduce their exposure to real estate, they're likely not going to want to reduce their exposure to industrial. So, I think -- and with these -- most of the open-end funds, where they're mixed, they're different property types, the industrial is what's holding up their performance. So, for them to dispose of those would put them in an even a more difficult situation. So, I don't think there will be a lot of forced sellers in industrial because to the extent that you're dealing with a leverage issue or liquidity issue, if you sell your highest yielding asset, you keep tightening the coverage noose around your neck. So, as much as I'd like to, I don't think we'll see a lot of that. I think where we could see opportunities is actually within our own open-end fund availabilities. If the redemptions continue on, we think the values are good. First, we'll offer that to all the third-party investors. And then, we'll step in and buy. And we like that real estate. We know it well, and we operate it. And if it's priced right, we're all buyers. No problem.Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please state your question.Mike Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks. I guess, I mean, I understand that PLD and the industrial space in general are pretty well positioned in the current environment despite the uncertainty. But is there anything that you're watching out for or any specific risks that you foresee for this space here in the next year plus or so?Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we are watching everything really carefully. I mean, I'm not -- believe me, we've been through enough cycles, and enough weird things can happen that none of us predict that we want to be vigilant. That's why we're starting out the year with very conservative assumptions and things that we can deliver. I mean, I think even on this basis, we're going to, I think, put up unbelievably good numbers. I mean, who can think of almost double-digit kind of returns or growth off of such strong growth, 14% per year earnings growth, consistently for the last three years? So, I think the arrow is up. But, yeah, I mean, you know, nobody predicted Putin going into Europe last year. Or it's usually the stuff that you don't -- you can't predict. I mean, am I worried about inflation really tanking our numbers? No. Am I really worried about recession tanking our numbers? No. Am I worried about e-commerce going out the window and people going back to shopping the old way without that percentage going up? No. I'm not worried about those things. But I am worried about things that I don't even know what to worry about, if you get my drift there. Anyway, so, yeah, there's always bad stuff that can happen that are out of the realm of normal projections.Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please state your question.Mike Mueller -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Yeah. Hi. What are the anticipated yields for your 2023 development starts?Dan Letter -- Global Head, Capital Deployment The anticipated -- this is Dan. The anticipated yields are actually up slightly, but still in the low 6's, 6.1-ish, 6.2-ish.Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question.Anthony Powell -- Barclays -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Question on utilization, which increased in the quarter. What drove that growth, given all the headlines we see about port volumes, whatnot declining? And how big of a driver of the higher utilization is for your outlook this year, given the strong outlook this year?Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I don't think utilization actually moved that much. I mean, the peak utilization ever, all time, was 87%. And I think that one point is well within the sampling bias that can take place because, you know, it's not a perfect data set. It's a sample of a large data set. So, I don't think there's a meaningful trend in -- certainly not a decelerating trend in utilization. With respect to port volumes, I think port volumes are pretty meaningless in the last -- really, since COVID started because there were so many, you know, fits and starts and, you know, things being in the wrong place and all that. And, yeah, the West Coast ports have lower volumes today than they did before. But the East Coast and Gulf ports are getting a lot more volume than they did before. So, on an aggregate basis, port volumes are just fine. And if you look at the lag that it takes, you know, too many empty containers on one side of the ocean, you know, and factories shutting down on the other side of the ocean and all that, I think until the market normalizes, you can't really draw any conclusions from port volumes. So, I don't see any either one of those two trends affecting demand. Chris, do you want to --Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research Yeah, I'll just build on that by saying, you know, two things are also happening. One is market vacancies in the U.S. are 3.2%, 3.3% lower in Europe. That, in its own right, creates some pent-up demand. And so, there's a need to push utilization within the facilities. And then, second, look, inventories are up 15% on a year-on-year basis, on a nominal basis, and 9%, 10% on a real basis. So, there is real structural demand lifting new demand, as well as in-place customers.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Notwithstanding that increase in real inventories, we still think we're less than half way toward equilibrium level of inventory, about 45% of the way there. So, we think there's a lot of tailwind behind inventories, too.Thank you. Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.Blaine Heck -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Great. Thanks. So, related to that last question and your comments on that progress toward equilibrium inventory, can you just talk about your recent conversations with customers? You know, what's your sense for how they're balancing the investment need and capex spend against concerns about the economic slowdown or recession and higher overall cost of capital?Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll pitch it to Mike for more detailed comments on this, but my sense is that customers don't have quite as much FOMO as they did before. In other words, they're not in the horde mentality of let's go get the space because if we don't, somebody else will and all that. I think the market has rationalized with respect to pace of leasing demand. And people are being more thoughtful about how they go about taking their -- taking space because forget about what they pay us in rent. I mean, every time you open a new large warehouse, there's a lot of capex that goes into it and all that. Real estate is the least of your worries. It's all the other stuff that you have to put in. So, I think people are cautious, but they also realize, particularly on the e-com side, that, you know, this was a theoretical threat, you know, before the COVID. Now, they see what really happened to their business during COVID. So, they're very anxious to build out their full e-commerce supply chain, which is oftentimes a different one than their brick-and-mortar supply chain. So, I would say demand has broadened. It's much less all about Amazon. It's much broader than that. But it's pretty strong. Is it the strongest it's ever been? No, it's not as strong as 2021. But compared to any 10-year period you want to look at, we would consider this very strong market. Mike?Mike Curless -- Chief Customer Officerw Yeah, I would just pile on. I mean, on a net basis, the activity is still very strong. Decision timelines definitely have stretched out, and people are being more cautious. But remember, these structural configurations we've been talking about for two or three years continue to march on, perhaps, at a bit of a slower rate. But ultimately, I think it comes down to the fear of not having the right space when you need it a year from now is overriding taking space just a little bit too early. So, broadly, we feel pretty good about this overall activity.Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question.Craig Mailman -- Citi -- Analyst Hey, guys. I just want to follow up on these demand discussions because this is a constant question I get from clients here. And maybe it's more of a Chris question, but, Hamid, feel free to jump in, too, just in terms of in this era of low vacancies, where really there's nothing at least a net absorption is not necessarily the best leading indicator of demand. I mean, what are you guys using at least to kind of use as your forward-looking indicator on demand or structure, something that the market could look to? Because it just seems like retentions are still high, availability is low, construction could fall off. But everyone is talking about inventories being higher, utilization being higher, so people needing less of the space. But it's just -- from your commentary, seems like this is not really filtering through to what you guys are seeing. And just some thoughts there. Then, you know, related to that, Chris, I mean, what would it take for market rents to actually turn negative? Because that's a question I get a lot as well. And I'm just kind of curious in your modeling, kind of what inputs would have to really turn to get that from, you know, the positive 10% you're seeing to somewhere below zero.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK, let me start, and I'm sure Chris can give much more color. I would state this. In 40 years of doing this, this is the biggest disconnect that I've seen between the macro economy and the prospects for our business. Usually, those two things are much more aligned. And this time around, there just appear to be completely disconnected for a variety of reasons that we talked about ad nauseum. So, I think where pricing goes away is vacancies going to 7% to 8% and staying there. And if you do the math on that, you need another, in the U.S., I don't know, 2 billion or 3 billion square feet of un-leased construction coming online. And you can't do it overnight. Maybe a billion, something. You know, we can do the math. But it's a big number. And you're not going to keep doing that. If the space that you -- if the first 100 million feet doesn't lease, you're not going to do that. And by the way, this cycle, you have a couple of big players in the business that have much more to gain from the fundamentals of the business being stronger, rents being stronger, than a few bucks they may make on additional development. So, there is an economic incentive to be disciplined. In prior cycles, mostly driven by merchant builders and private developers, they don't really care what the rental market was. They just wanted to build the product and sell it to somebody else, and that would be their problem. Today, those two sites are connected to one another. So, I think the motivations are really different. And absent a nuclear war type of scenario, I just don't see vacancy rates going to a level that will lead to a reduction in rents. It's either going to be a demand collapse or a supply explosion, and I don't see either one of them happening. The other thing I would say is that we are -- we lease a million square feet on a daily basis. Let's get our heads around that, a million square feet on a daily basis. You know, we throw these big numbers around without really fully appreciating what the scale of that is. I mean, that is 10x the amount of space anybody else leases in any sector in real estate. So, by watching these customers and their behavior, obviously, we'll figure out if some bad stuff is about to happen and won't be waiting for the quarterly report to analyze that. So, Chris, do you have specifics?Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research Yeah, a couple of specifics. I would lead with our proprietary data leads us to these conclusions. So, for example, our sales force pipeline. If we look at the vacancy that we do have, 46% has deals working. That's in line or above the average that we've experienced through COVID. To say nothing of the conversations that Mike and Scott and our customer led solutions team have. In terms of public data, which I think I heard you ask about, Craig, we do publish our IBI survey and our utilization data. And so, figures like 60 on our IBI, it's a diffusion index, so that's consistent with this good or great tone that the team has struck, and 86% on utilization, which was discussed earlier, are ways that you can see that in the marketplace. And then, as it relates to what it would take for rents to fall, Hamid described it very specifically, and I'd add one piece of data that I don't see commonly discussed in the marketplace but is important to know, which is development starts rather than development completions. Starts in the U.S., we're off by a third in the fourth quarter relative to their 2022 trend. And on the continent in Europe, they were off by 45%. So, we're seeing a sharp marking to market of the capital market environment, the valuation environment, and what those buildings might be worth for some of those other folks building buildings.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer By the way, banks are a lot more disciplined because now, they have risk-based capital requirements. So, putting out a lot of construction loans on buildings that don't lease like used to happen in prior cycles is less likely to happen. So, I think the market is generally smarter. There's a lot more data. Conversations like we're having today never used to take place two decades ago. So, the cycles are much more amplified. I think it's pretty hard for that to happen. But something can come out of left field. I'm not discounting that possibility. Something really bad could come out of left field and change all this, but I just can't think of what that thing would be. But none of us predicted the pandemic, I don't think, so, you know, things can happen.Thank you. And our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please state your question.Vince Tibone -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get any color on recent market rent growth and how that may differ between suite side. Like, are you seeing any differences in performance between bulk buildings and, you know, smaller, more infill facilities?Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I would generally tell you that the smaller spaces are having a tougher time to the extent that anybody is having a tougher time. But Chris is looking up the specifics. They're not radically different. But why don't we do this? Why don't we go to the next -- you got it? OK. Yeah.Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research Hey, no, glad to help you out here. First off, market rent growth had great momentum at the end of the year with 5% growth in the U.S., 3% in Europe. When we look at rent change, which is a great way to understand performance and suite size, it's strong across the board. But in fact, late in the year, we saw an improvement in those smaller units, which might be where your question is coming from.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Oh, yeah.Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research So, it's diverse.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. That's different than I would have guessed. And I bet you it's because there was more available space to absorb in those categories. Those categories were less leased. And by the way, we have them, too. I mean, we have some smaller than 100,000 square-foot units. So, I would say, occupancy was a little bit lower, so there was more room to lease product than the higher end.Chris Caton -- Senior Vice President, Research If we flip it to submarkets and we look at, say, infill, which tend to have those smaller units, infill outperformed in the U.S. by 400 basis points last year. So, say 34% in the U.S. in the infill submarkets versus 30% for the whole of the United States.And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.Jamie Feldman -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up from Blaine and myself. So, where do you expect to make the most progress on the essentials business in '23? And how does that factor into your guidance and earnings? And then, also, if you could just, say, you know, where you think cap rates are today versus, you know, the peak this cycle, how much they've moved. Thank you.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, two things. I think the essential business in terms of percentage growth, I think our mobility business would be the biggest because it's the smallest right now to start with. So, any growth will be the biggest. But in terms of dollar contribution, I would say solar and storage are coming on the strongest today. And operations is a close second behind. I'll pitch it to Gary if he has any more to say about that after this. Second part of the question was -- oh, cap rates. So, cap rates are really misleading. So, we got to be careful about that cap rates at market, assuming that you had a building a year and a half ago at market and you have a building at market today, I would guess it's 50 to 75 basis points, maybe 100 basis points, OK? It's, call it, 50 to 100 basis points. But you've had all this rental growth in between. So, the observed cap rate for the same building this year versus last year, with rents that are higher by, I don't know, 10%, 15% or something, would not have moved as much. So -- and if you get into weird situations, like some building that was leased five years ago and it comes on the market, and the in-place rent is less than half of what market is, that building could have a lower cap rate than it would have had, you know, a year ago. IRR is what's really important based on reasonable assumptions. And my guess is that if I were going to pick a number, I would say low to -- low seven, 7.25-ish in the U.S., and maybe a little bit lower than that in Europe, with growth of, say, 4%-ish across a 10-year projection. Something like that, approximately. Gary, anything on --Gary Anderson -- Chief Operating Officer I think you hit it exactly, Hamid. I mean, just in 2023, our mix is going to be about 50% operations and about 50% energy and mobility. The growth rate, obviously, mobility is going to be much higher because it's coming off of basically a zero base. Where are we investing? We're investing in our energy and mobility businesses. And that's where we have proven our capability because that's where we see the most significant growth over '25 and beyond. But I mean, just to put a sort of stake in this, we are very, very convicted about the potential for these businesses. We're on track to generate our 300 million in revenues and tax benefits by 2025, which we've talked about before. And that is going to deliver about $0.25 per share in FFO. And that would be a little bit above 100 -- that'll be about 100 basis points of growth per year compared to our 2019 investor day estimates of about 50 basis points. So, net-net, look, we are in great shape. That business is growing right on plan. And we're going to continue to make investments in that business. And this year, it's going to be in mobility and energy.Hamid Moghadam -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer By the way, that 2025 number that Gary just mentioned is going to be with capturing maybe 15%, 20% of the total opportunity within our portfolio. So, there'll be a huge runway for growth. And frankly, we're beginning to see more deals out of our own platform because customers are taking us to buildings that they leased from other people to do the same level of service to them in those other situations. So, I can't even begin to quantify that out-of-platform opportunity. So, we're really excited about our essentials business. OK, thanks. I think we're at the top of the hour. I know we have one more question, but maybe we can take that outside the call, Anthony, with our apologies. But thank you for your interest in the company, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care.\""
